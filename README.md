## Description:
Create an employee directory with React. This will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

User Story -
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

Business Context -
* An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Installation Instructions: 
1) npm i on App.js


## Test Command: 
To test filter type male or female into input box and click button - be sure to refresh page with refresh button after done with the filtered information.

To sort simply click any header text to sort the entire table by that column alphabetically.
